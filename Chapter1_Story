Chapter I: ancient war ends. episode I: rise of midstar
the mids and stars have been fighting for years, it all started when two rulers got greedy over the power sources, the rulers 
were brothers, midler and starpo. There people were dertermined for for the main source. Then one day, Starpo declared his army 
as the stars and midler decalred his as the mids. they split the power source equally among there people, yet starpo was greedy 
for more so he decided he wanted to get midler's people's power source.

This is where the introduction of Chapter 1 ends. chapter 2's story will be on ther way
IMPORTANT: there are 3 chapters within each episode so I'll need ideas for the story, also I need voice actors and people 
to help with the script, Thanks for reading :P
